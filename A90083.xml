            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Sunday morning my Lord <hi>Strange</hi> now Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> for his father died this week at <hi>Chester,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mollineux,</hi> Sir <hi>John Girlington</hi> high Sherif of the County of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerard</hi> Colonell of the Horse, with diverse other Captaines and
<pb facs="tcp:117257:3"/> Gentlemen of the County, with some six or seven Canons, came likewise neere unto the Towne; But the Tounsmen, having some notice on the Saturday evening of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, did send to the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, who on Sunday and Monday came in abundantly with Muskets, Pikes, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts, Staves and such like, to the number of two thousand, And these Gentlemen likewise came in aid of the Towne, Master <hi>Holland,</hi> Master <hi>Egerton,</hi> Master <hi>Ducken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> Master <hi>Arden,</hi> Master <hi>Butterworth,</hi> Master <hi>Booth,</hi> Sir <hi>Georges</hi> second Sonne, Master <hi>Hide</hi> and some others.</p>
            <p>And upon Sunday fore-noone we were called out of Church from Sermon, and since then there have beene many hot skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes both in the Night and Day, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Monday in the afternoone, and in the night, their Ordinance killed none but onely a strange Boy was gazing about him but not in Armes.</p>
            <p>There have not beene slaine of the Towns side above five or six and as many
<pb facs="tcp:117257:3"/> taken prisoners, there are slaine on the other side about an hundred and fifty, whereof some speciall Commanders, Master <hi>Standish</hi> of <hi>Tuxbury</hi> is slaine, Captaine <hi>Biron,</hi> Captaine <hi>Tilesley,</hi> and many others of good quality, and about an hundred taken Prisoners; The Souldier hath ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sackt and pillag'd, and done abundance of hurt in the Country thereabouts; The Towns-men fetch them in, and bring in Horse and man in great companies, foure or five bring in two or three a peece.</p>
            <p>Upon Monday night they burnt a great Barne with much Corne and Hay of M. <hi>Greenes,</hi> and some Houses of Master <hi>Foxes</hi> at the Deanes Gate end, The Towne is daily expectant of ayde from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Army, Wee have beene full of feares, oftē called out of Bed in the night, and in great distresse, but Gods great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath greatly preserved us beyond all expectation, If I would but relate unto you all the passages it would fill you with admiration, to see how gratious God hath
<pb facs="tcp:117257:4"/> beene to us, but the Towne is the better for some fortifications made by a <hi>German,</hi> by Chaines, and Mudwalls at the Townes ends, and I hope much the better for good Prayers, The matter is the more unkindly taken, because the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> hath brought some that were sent from the Town upon his warrant to meete the King at <hi>Warrington,</hi> against the <hi>Towne,</hi> and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers say they had no knowledge of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming against <hi>Manchester,</hi> But were tould they were to goe for some other purpose that way, They say Captaine <hi>Leigh</hi> of <hi>Adling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> is at <hi>Storkport,</hi> with Forces against the Towne, but they say they will not goe out of the County, Captaine <hi>Robert Bradshaw,</hi> Captaine <hi>Radelife,</hi> Captaine <hi>Channell,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Barrington</hi> hath done very great service.</p>
            <p>This is the substance of what I know, I have been in Town all the time, The Lord grant us peace, Pray for us and the peace of this Kingdome.</p>
